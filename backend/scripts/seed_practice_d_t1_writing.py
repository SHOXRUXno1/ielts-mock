"""Seed Practice Set D Test 1 Writing.

Task 1: bar charts — French regional languages spoken to children by
        parents vs adults who speak a regional language to their own children.
Task 2: discuss both views — stress (past vs present).

Wording is taken from the printed paper (pp.44-46). Teaching tip strips
are not part of the exam and are omitted.

Usage:
    cd backend
